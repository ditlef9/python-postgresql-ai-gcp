![Python, PostgreSQL on Google Cloud Platform Logo](_docs/python-postgresql-ai-google-cloud-platform-logo.png) 

This project shows how you can use **PostgreSQL** in
**Python** on the **Google Cloud Platform** and **locally**.

In this repository we have three projects:

- **üîê Encrypt and Decrypt PDF Function** with Buckets.
- **üßë‚Äçüíª Python User System Flask App (Backend) with PostgreSQL** lets users register and login to a backend.
- **ü§ñ Mental Health Check-In Assistant with AI** 
- **üß¨ Lifestyle-Based Health Risk Scoring System Machine Learning**

## üéØ 1 Applications

### üîê [Encrypt and Decrypt PDFs Function](encrypt-and-decrypt-pdfs)

* **Runs on:** Google Cloud Run Functions
* **GCP Services:**
  * Secret Manager 
 
* **Description:**
  PDF documents are stored in a Google Cloud Bucket named **originals**. 
  The documents there are encrypted into a directory named **encrypted**.
  When they are decrypted they are stored in a directory named **decrypted**.
  

### üßë‚Äçüíª [Python User System Flask App (Backend) with PostgreSQL](user-system)

* **Runs on:** Google Cloud Run
* **GCP Services:**
  * Cloud SQL (PostgreSQL)
  * Secret Manager

* **Description:**
  A basic user management system that handles sign-up, login, password hashing, 
  and user sessions using Flask and PostgreSQL. 
  
  Secret Manager securely stores database credentials, 
  and the service is deployed on Cloud Run with auto-scaling. 

  The project introduces secure cloud architecture, relational database access, 
  and containerized deployment.
  


### ü§ñ [Mental Health Check-In Assistant with AI](mental-health-check-in-assistant-with-ai)

* Runs on: Google Cloud Run
* GCP Services: 
  * Vertex AI (LLM: PaLM/Gemini)
  * Secret Manager
  * Firestore (for storing journal entries)
  
* Description:
  Many people struggle to reflect on their mental health or spot patterns. 
  This app helps users write a daily mood journal and receive an AI-generated reflection or suggestion, 
  like ‚ÄúYou seem anxious lately. Would taking a walk or journaling more help?‚Äù

  How it works:
    * User submits a short daily entry (text: how they feel, what happened).
    * Python backend sends this to Vertex AI via prompt, asking for:
      * Mood summary
      * Emotional trends
      * A gentle reflection or suggestion

    * Stores the entry + AI feedback in Firestore.

### üß¨ [Lifestyle-Based Health Risk Scoring System Machine Learning](lifestyle-based-health-risk-scoring-system-ml)

* Runs on: Google Cloud Run
* GCP Services:
  * Cloud Storage (for uploading or accessing test documents/data)
  * Firestore
  * Secret Manager 
  * Trained Scikit-learn model or TensorFlow Lite model

* Description:
  Many people get blood tests and have health habits (like smoking, exercise, etc.), 
  but don‚Äôt know how all their lifestyle and environmental factors add up to influence their overall health risk. 
  This app takes structured input and outputs a personalized health risk score.


  How it works:
    * User fills in a form (or uploads a JSON) with:
      * Blood test results (e.g. cholesterol, liver enzymes)
      * Lifestyle: exercise frequency, smoking, stress levels, diet
      * Exposures: radiation, environmental toxins, steroids, pharma
      * Nutrition: vitamins, minerals, amino acids
      * Subjective metrics: peace of mind, etc.

    * App runs a custom trained ML model to:
      * Predict a general health risk score (e.g., 0‚Äì100)
      * Optionally suggest which categories are most contributing to risk (feature importance)

    * Results stored in Firestore and shown via API.

## üíª 2 Software Needed

Please install the following software:

* [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads) ‚Äì The core programming language used in this project. 

* [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download) ‚Äì A powerful IDE for Python development. 
It provides features like smart code completion, debugging, and project management.

* [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/download) ‚Äì The relational database used to store and manage data.
Note: On **Mac and Linux**, you also need to install pgAdmin, a GUI for managing your PostgreSQL databases.
(*pgAdmin is already included in the Windows PostgreSQL installer.*)

* [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) ‚Äì A version control system used to manage and collaborate on your codebase. 
Essential for cloning the repo and contributing to the project.
