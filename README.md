![Python, PostgreSQL on Google Cloud Platform Logo](_docs/python-postgresql-google-cloud-platform-logo.png) 

This project shows how you can use **PostgreSQL** in
**Python** on the **Google Cloud Platform** and **locally**.

This boilerplate provides a clean, minimal setup to jumpstart development using:

- **Python (FastAPI / Flask)** for backend logic
- **PostgreSQL** as the primary relational database
- **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)** for cloud deployment (Cloud Run, Cloud SQL and Secret Manager)

## ‚òÅÔ∏è 1 üõ† Software Needed

Please install the following software:

* [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads) ‚Äì The core programming language used in this project. 

* [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download) ‚Äì A powerful IDE for Python development. 
It provides features like smart code completion, debugging, and project management.


* [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/download) ‚Äì The relational database used to store and manage data.
Note: On **Mac and Linux**, you also need to install pgAdmin, a GUI for managing your PostgreSQL databases.
(*pgAdmin is already included in the Windows PostgreSQL installer.*)

* [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) ‚Äì A version control system used to manage and collaborate on your codebase. 
Essential for cloning the repo and contributing to the project.
